# GuixSwayVM
## Real Life connections require a digital OS to access online resources, this configuration makes a small but quickly expandable OS for online resource access and use. 
 --- If you already use Guix the config.scm is almost all you need, but incase people need help I'll walk through this step by step.
## Use a virtual machine to build this ...
 --- As noted in the config.scm this does not include sufficent network drivers. I'll try to get a Guix Sway going for the Desktop, but two key things to consider if I do; It won't be smaller that 10GB and It won't work on all desktops.
